# field-color-palette

## Installation

First, install the package using composer:

```bash
composer require kirki-framework/control-color-palette
```

Make sure you include the autoloader:
```php
require_once get_parent_theme_file_path( 'vendor/autoload.php' );
```

This control is an alias of the [`react-color`](https://github.com/kirki-framework/control-react-color) control, using the `CirclePicker`.
